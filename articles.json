    "byline": "By Murtaza Bharmal, MD · Interventional Cardiologist · February 3, 2026",
    "body": "\n        <h3>Why This Matters</h3>\n        <p>Every week I see patients who have stopped their statin — or are afraid to start one — because of something they read online or heard from a friend. Statins are among the most studied medications in history, with decades of large randomized trials behind them. Yet misinformation persists. Let me address the most common concerns directly.</p>\n\n        <div class=\"article-callout\">\"Stopping a statin without talking to your doctor is one of the most common — and most preventable — reasons I see patients return to the hospital.\"</div>\n\n        <h3>Myth #1: \"Statins cause muscle damage\"</h3>\n        <p>Muscle aches (<em>myalgia</em>) do occur in a small percentage of patients — roughly 5–10% in real-world settings, though clinical trials suggest it may be lower. True muscle breakdown (<em>rhabdomyolysis</em>) is rare, occurring in fewer than 1 in 10,000 patients. Importantly, if you experience muscle pain on a statin, <strong>tell your doctor before stopping</strong>. Often a dose adjustment, switch to a different statin, or alternate-day dosing resolves the issue entirely.</p>\n\n        <h3>Myth #2: \"Statins cause memory loss or dementia\"</h3>\n        <p>This concern gained traction after anecdotal reports in the early 2000s. However, large population studies — including a 2016 meta-analysis of over 50,000 patients — found <strong>no causal link</strong> between statins and cognitive decline. In fact, some data suggest statins may be protective against vascular dementia by reducing stroke risk.</p>\n\n        <h3>Myth #3: \"Statins are just a money-making scheme — lifestyle is enough\"</h3>\n        <p>Lifestyle absolutely matters — diet, exercise, and weight management are foundational. But for patients with established cardiovascular disease or high LDL driven by genetics (familial hypercholesterolemia), lifestyle alone is often insufficient. Statins reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke by 25–35% in high-risk individuals. That is a meaningful, proven benefit.</p>\n\n        <h3>Myth #4: \"Once you start, you're on them forever\"</h3>\n        <p>Not necessarily. The decision to continue, adjust, or stop a statin should be revisited regularly with your cardiologist based on your current risk profile, LDL levels, and any side effects. Some patients achieve sufficient LDL reduction through aggressive lifestyle changes and can reduce their dose. Others may transition to newer agents like PCSK9 inhibitors if statins are not tolerated.</p>\n\n        <h3>What I Tell My Own Patients</h3>\n        <p>If you have been prescribed a statin, there is almost certainly a specific clinical reason — whether it is your LDL level, a prior cardiac event, diabetes, or a strong family history. Before stopping, have a direct conversation with your doctor. The risk of an undertreated lipid panel is real and measurable. The risk of a well-monitored statin, in most patients, is very low.</p>\n\n        <div class=\"article-callout\">\"The best medication is the one you actually take — and understand why you're taking it.\"</div>\n\n        <div class=\"article-refs\">\n          <div class=\"article-refs-title\">References</div>\n          <ol>\n            <li>Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' (CTT) Collaboration. <em>Lancet.</em> 2010;376(9753):1670–1681.

    "title": "Omega-3s & Your Heart — What the Evidence Actually Says",
    "byline": "By Murtaza Bharmal, MD · Interventional Cardiologist · February 7, 2026",
    "body": "\n        <h3>Why Everyone Is Talking About Omega-3s</h3>\n        <p>Walk into any pharmacy and the fish oil aisle is overwhelming — dozens of brands, wildly different doses, capsules, liquids, prescription formulations. Patients ask me about omega-3s almost every week. The honest answer is more nuanced than most supplement marketing would have you believe. Here is what the science actually shows.</p>\n\n        <h3>What Are Omega-3 Fatty Acids?</h3>\n        <p>Omega-3s are a family of polyunsaturated fatty acids. The two most relevant for heart health are <strong>EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid)</strong> and <strong>DHA (docosahexaenoic acid)</strong> — both found primarily in fatty fish and fish oil supplements. A third, ALA (alpha-linolenic acid), is found in plant sources like flaxseed, but the body converts it to EPA and DHA very inefficiently, making it a poor substitute for cardiac purposes.</p>\n\n        <div class=\"article-callout\">\"The difference between a 1g fish oil capsule from the drugstore and a prescription-dose omega-3 is not just marketing — the clinical evidence behind them is genuinely different.\"</div>\n\n        <h3>What the Landmark Trials Show</h3>\n        <p>For years, moderate-dose omega-3 trials (1g/day) showed disappointing results. The ORIGIN trial (2012) and several meta-analyses found no significant reduction in cardiovascular events at low doses. This led many to dismiss fish oil entirely — which was premature.</p>\n        <p>The game-changer was <strong>REDUCE-IT (2018)</strong> — a large randomized trial of over 8,000 high-risk patients that tested <em>high-dose</em> icosapentaenoic acid (4g/day of pure EPA, as the prescription drug icosapent ethyl / Vascepa). The results were striking: a <strong>25% relative reduction</strong> in major cardiovascular events including heart attack, stroke, and cardiovascular death — on top of statin therapy.</p>\n        <p>However, a subsequent trial, <strong>STRENGTH (2020)</strong>, tested a different high-dose omega-3 formulation (EPA + DHA combined) and found no cardiovascular benefit. This suggests the benefit seen in REDUCE-IT may be specific to <strong>pure EPA</strong> rather than omega-3s in general — an area of ongoing research and debate.</p>\n\n        <h3>So Should You Take Fish Oil?</h3>\n        <p>Here is how I think about it in practice:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li><strong>High-risk patients with elevated triglycerides (≥150 mg/dL) already on a statin:</strong> Prescription icosapent ethyl (Vascepa) has strong evidence and is FDA-approved for cardiovascular risk reduction. This is a meaningful medication, not a supplement.</li>\n          <li><strong>Patients with very high triglycerides (≥500 mg/dL):</strong> High-dose omega-3s (prescription) are a first-line treatment to reduce pancreatitis risk.</li>\n          <li><strong>General population taking OTC fish oil for heart protection:</strong> The evidence at 1g/day is weak. You are likely getting more benefit from eating 2 servings of fatty fish per week (salmon, mackerel, sardines) than from a standard drugstore capsule.</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <h3>What About Diet vs. Supplements?</h3>\n        <p>The Mediterranean diet — rich in fatty fish, olive oil, nuts, and vegetables — consistently shows cardiovascular benefit in large studies including the landmark <strong>PREDIMED trial</strong>. Food-first is always my preferred approach. Supplements fill gaps; they rarely replicate the benefits of whole food patterns.</p>\n        <p>If you do supplement, look for products that are <strong>third-party tested</strong> (NSF, USP, or IFOS certified), list EPA and DHA content separately on the label, and store them in the refrigerator to prevent oxidation — rancid fish oil may actually be harmful.</p>\n\n        <div class=\"article-callout\">\"Eat two servings of fatty fish a week. If you have high triglycerides and cardiovascular risk, ask your cardiologist about prescription-grade EPA. Skip the mega-dose drugstore fish oil — the evidence just isn't there.\"</div>\n\n        <h3>The Bottom Line</h3>\n        <p>Omega-3s are not snake oil — but they are also not a cardiac cure-all. The prescription form of pure EPA has genuine evidence in the right patient. For most people, the best omega-3 strategy is dietary: more salmon, less ultra-processed food. As always, talk to your doctor before starting any new supplement, especially if you are on blood thinners, as high-dose omega-3s can increase bleeding risk.</p>\n\n        <div class=\"article-refs\">\n          <div class=\"article-refs-title\">References</div>\n          <ol>\n            <li>Bhatt DL, et al.

    "byline": "By Murtaza Bharmal, MD · Interventional Cardiologist · February 11, 2026",
    "body": "\n        <h3>The Most Underused Prescription in Cardiology</h3>\n        <p>If exercise could be packaged into a pill, it would be the most widely prescribed medication in history. The evidence for physical activity in cardiovascular disease prevention is as strong as almost anything we have in medicine — yet the majority of American adults still don't meet basic activity guidelines. As a cardiologist, I think about exercise as a clinical intervention, not just a lifestyle suggestion. Here is what the science says and how I counsel my patients.</p>\n\n        <div class=\"article-callout\">\"Exercise is the closest thing we have to a polypill — it lowers blood pressure, improves cholesterol, reduces blood sugar, decreases inflammation, and strengthens the heart. And it's free.\"</div>\n\n        <h3>What the Guidelines Actually Say</h3>\n        <p>The 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, endorsed by the American Heart Association, recommend:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li><strong>At least 150 minutes per week</strong> of moderate-intensity aerobic activity (brisk walking, cycling, swimming), OR</li>\n          <li><strong>75 minutes per week</strong> of vigorous-intensity activity (running, HIIT, fast cycling), OR</li>\n          <li>An equivalent combination of both</li>\n          <li><strong>Muscle-strengthening activities</strong> (resistance training) on 2 or more days per week</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>That breaks down to just 22 minutes of moderate exercise per day — far less daunting than most people assume.</p>\n\n        <h3>More Is Better — Up to a Point</h3>\n        <p>A landmark analysis of over 650,000 adults published in <em>JAMA Internal Medicine</em> found that meeting the minimum guidelines reduced mortality risk by 31% compared to being inactive. Those who exercised 3–5 times the minimum had a 39% reduction. Beyond that, additional benefit plateaus — but importantly, very high volumes of exercise (marathon training, ultra-endurance athletics) do not appear to be harmful for most people either.</p>\n        <p>The key message: <strong>any amount of movement is better than none</strong>, and the biggest gains come from going from sedentary to minimally active.</p>\n\n        <h3>Aerobic vs. Resistance Training — Do You Need Both?</h3>\n        <p>Yes, and they do different things. Aerobic exercise primarily improves cardiovascular fitness (VO2 max), lowers resting heart rate, reduces blood pressure, and improves lipid profiles. Resistance training builds muscle mass, improves insulin sensitivity, strengthens bones, and reduces all-cause mortality independently of aerobic fitness. A 2022 study in the <em>British Journal of Sports Medicine</em> found that combining both types reduced cardiovascular mortality risk by 46% — more than either alone.</p>\n\n        <h3>What About High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)?</h3>\n        <p>HIIT — alternating short bursts of intense effort with recovery periods — has gained popularity for good reason. Studies show it produces comparable or superior cardiovascular adaptations to moderate continuous exercise in significantly less time. For my busy patients, a 20-minute HIIT session 3 times a week can meet guidelines efficiently. However, for patients with established coronary artery disease or recent cardiac events, HIIT should only be started under physician guidance.</p>\n\n        <div class=\"article-callout\">\"I tell my patients: you don't need a gym membership or an hour a day. A 25-minute brisk walk most days of the week is genuinely, meaningfully good for your heart.\"</div>\n\n        <h3>Exercise After a Cardiac Event</h3>\n        <p>Cardiac rehabilitation — supervised exercise following a heart attack, bypass surgery, or stent placement — reduces cardiovascular mortality by 20–25% and hospital readmission rates significantly. Yet fewer than 25% of eligible patients complete cardiac rehab. If you or a family member has had a cardiac event, please ask your cardiologist for a formal cardiac rehab referral. It is one of the highest-value interventions we have.</p>\n\n        <h3>Practical Starting Points</h3>\n        <ul>\n          <li><strong>Start where you are.</strong> If you are currently sedentary, even 10-minute walks are beneficial and a realistic starting point.</li>\n          <li><strong>Consistency beats intensity.</strong> Showing up 5 days a week at moderate effort beats heroic weekend sessions followed by inactivity.</li>\n          <li><strong>Find something you enjoy.</strong> The best exercise is the one you will actually do — whether that is pickleball, dancing, swimming, or hiking.</li>\n          <li><strong>Track it simply.</strong> A step goal of 7,000–10,000 steps per day correlates strongly with reduced cardiovascular events in multiple large studies.</li>\n          <li><strong>Talk to your doctor first</strong> if you have known heart disease, recent cardiac symptoms, or multiple risk factors before starting a new vigorous exercise program.</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <div class=\"article-refs\">\n          <div class=\"article-refs-title\">References</div>\n          <ol>\n            <li>Arem H, et al.

    "body": "<h3>Why Hypertension Is Called the Silent Killer</h3><p>Most patients with high blood pressure feel completely normal — no headaches, no warning signs. That's what makes it dangerous: it quietly damages arteries, heart, kidneys, and brain for years. Nearly half of American adults have hypertension, yet only 1 in 4 have it controlled. In my clinic, I see the consequences of undertreated blood pressure every week.</p><div class=\"article-callout\">\"Know your numbers. If your blood pressure is consistently above 130/80, talk to your doctor — lifestyle changes and medications work, but only if we start them.\"</div><h3>What the Numbers Mean</h3><p>Blood pressure is systolic (top) over diastolic (bottom) in mmHg. AHA categories: Normal (below 120/80), Elevated (120–129/below 80), Stage 1 (130–139/80–89), Stage 2 (140+/90+), Crisis (180+/120+). Cardiovascular risk rises continuously above 115/75 — the 130/80 threshold reflects where meaningful risk begins.</p><h3>Lifestyle vs. Medication</h3><p>For Stage 1 without other risk factors, lifestyle modification is the right first step. The DASH diet alone reduces systolic BP by 8–11 mmHg — comparable to a medication. Aerobic exercise, sodium restriction, alcohol limitation, and weight loss all independently lower blood pressure. Stage 2 hypertension or Stage 1 with coexisting risk factors typically warrant medication. First-line options — thiazides, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, calcium channel blockers — are effective, inexpensive, and well tolerated.</p><h3>Home Monitoring</h3><p>Office readings are notoriously variable. Home monitoring with a validated cuff provides a much more accurate picture — twice daily for a week, then share the log with your doctor.

But for cardiologists, the story goes far deeper. These medications are now proven to directly reduce cardiovascular events — reshaping how we think about preventive cardiology.</p><h3>What Are GLP-1 Receptor Agonists?</h3><p>GLP-1 is a hormone released from the gut after eating. It stimulates insulin, suppresses glucagon, slows gastric emptying, and reduces appetite. GLP-1 receptor agonists mimic these effects. Originally developed for type 2 diabetes, their cardiovascular benefits — discovered in large outcome trials — have dramatically expanded their role in cardiology.</p><div class=\"article-callout\">\"GLP-1 receptor agonists are not just weight loss drugs.

The SELECT trial showed benefit even before significant weight loss, supporting direct cardiac effects.</p><h3>Who Should Consider a GLP-1?</h3><p>Current evidence supports use in: patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease or high CV risk; non-diabetic patients with obesity (BMI ≥27) and established cardiovascular disease (SELECT trial); and HFpEF patients with obesity.

They're frightening, especially the first time. The vast majority are benign, but some represent arrhythmias that warrant evaluation. Here's how to think about them.</p><h3>What Causes Palpitations?</h3><p>Most palpitations are caused by premature beats — PACs (premature atrial contractions) or PVCs (premature ventricular contractions). These extra heartbeats create a \"thump\" or \"skipped beat\" sensation when the heart contracts strongly after a compensatory pause. PACs and PVCs are extremely common and most often completely benign. Other causes: anxiety, caffeine, alcohol, sleep deprivation, dehydration, thyroid dysfunction, anemia, stimulant medications, and rarely significant arrhythmias like AFib or ventricular tachycardia.</p><div class=\"article-callout\">\"Isolated palpitations in a young, healthy person are almost always benign. The same symptom in someone with known heart disease deserves prompt evaluation.\"</div><h3>Warning Signs Requiring Prompt Evaluation</h3><p>Seek rapid evaluation for: palpitations with chest pain, shortness of breath, or fainting; palpitations in anyone with known structural heart disease or prior MI; sustained rapid palpitations lasting more than a few minutes; palpitations with lightheadedness during exertion. These features suggest potentially significant arrhythmia.</p><h3>The Evaluation</h3><p>Initial workup: EKG, basic labs (thyroid, electrolytes, CBC), and detailed history. If frequent, a Holter monitor (24–48hr) or extended event monitor (up to 30 days) can capture rhythm during symptoms. Echocardiogram for structural evaluation is often obtained when concerning features are present.</p><h3>Smartwatches and Consumer ECGs</h3><p>Apple Watch, Fitbit, and similar devices with ECG capability can detect AFib with reasonable accuracy and have increased detection of previously undiagnosed cases. They generate false positives — don't self-diagnose, but do share wearable rhythm alerts with your cardiologist for proper evaluation.</p><div class=\"article-refs\"><div class=\"article-refs-title\">References</div><ol><li>Zimetbaum P, Josephson ME.

    "body": "<h3>The Most Googled Cardiovascular Question</h3><p>\"How do I lower my cholesterol?\" is one of the most frequently searched health questions in America. Elevated LDL is one of the most modifiable cardiovascular risk factors. Here's what the evidence supports, ranked from most to least impactful.</p><h3>1. Statins — Most Effective Single Intervention</h3><p>No lifestyle intervention comes close to statin efficacy for significant LDL reduction. High-intensity statins (atorvastatin 40–80mg, rosuvastatin 20–40mg) reduce LDL by 50–60%. If your doctor has recommended a statin, the evidence overwhelmingly supports taking it.</p><h3>2. Diet — High Impact When Done Right</h3><p>Most impactful dietary changes: eliminate trans fats (now largely accomplished through FDA bans); reduce saturated fat and replace with unsaturated fats (olive oil, nuts, avocado); increase soluble fiber (oats, barley, legumes) — reduces LDL by 5–10%; add plant sterols and stanols — reduce LDL by 6–15% by blocking cholesterol absorption.</p><h3>3. Exercise — Primarily Raises HDL</h3><p>Regular aerobic exercise primarily raises HDL and lowers triglycerides, with modest LDL reduction (5–10%). The cardiovascular benefits far exceed what's explained by lipid changes alone — but don't rely on exercise as the primary LDL-lowering strategy if numbers are significantly elevated.</p><h3>4. Ezetimibe — The Underused Option</h3><p>Ezetimibe reduces LDL an additional 15–25% by blocking intestinal cholesterol absorption. Inexpensive, well-tolerated, now generic. The IMPROVE-IT trial showed significant cardiovascular event reduction when added to statins. My first add-on when statin alone doesn't reach LDL targets.</p><h3>5. PCSK9 Inhibitors — For Highest-Risk Patients</h3><p>For familial hypercholesterolemia or very high-risk patients who can't reach LDL targets on maximally tolerated statins, PCSK9 inhibitors (evolocumab / Repatha, alirocumab / Praluent) reduce LDL an additional 50–60%. Robust cardiovascular outcome data support their use.</p><div class=\"article-callout\">\"Diet and exercise matter — but if your LDL is significantly elevated, lifestyle alone won't get you to goal.

They are not the same condition — they have different causes, presentations, and critically, different immediate responses. Understanding the distinction could determine whether someone survives.</p><h3>Heart Attack — A Plumbing Problem</h3><p>A heart attack (myocardial infarction) occurs when a coronary artery is suddenly blocked — usually by a blood clot on a ruptured atherosclerotic plaque. Heart muscle is deprived of oxygen and begins to die. The heart typically keeps beating. Classic symptoms: chest pain/pressure, shortness of breath, sweating, nausea, arm or jaw pain. The patient is usually conscious. Treatment: open the blocked artery as fast as possible — ideally within 90 minutes in the cath lab.</p><h3>Cardiac Arrest — An Electrical Problem</h3><p>Cardiac arrest occurs when the heart's electrical system malfunctions so severely that the heart stops pumping blood effectively. Most common cause: ventricular fibrillation (chaotic electrical activity). Without blood flow, the brain begins dying within 4–6 minutes. The person collapses suddenly, is unresponsive, with no normal breathing or pulse. Cardiac arrest can be triggered by a heart attack, but also by severe arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, electrolyte abnormalities, and structural abnormalities in young athletes.</p><div class=\"article-callout\">\"Every minute without CPR or defibrillation during cardiac arrest reduces survival by 7–10%.

    "byline": "By Murtaza Bharmal, MD · Interventional Cardiologist · October 10, 2025",
    "body": "<h3>The Most Feared Coronary Artery</h3><p>The \"widowmaker\" refers to a complete blockage of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery — the largest coronary artery in most people, supplying the front wall and a significant portion of the left ventricle. A proximal LAD occlusion is one of the most dangerous coronary events in medicine. It earned its grim name because, before modern interventional cardiology, it was often fatal before help could arrive.</p><h3>Why the LAD Is So Critical</h3><p>The LAD typically supplies the anterior wall, the apex, and the interventricular septum. A proximal LAD blockage can put 40–50% of the left ventricular muscle at risk of infarction. When that much muscle stops contracting, the heart's pumping function collapses rapidly — causing cardiogenic shock and high risk of ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest.</p><div class=\"article-callout\">\"In the cath lab, when we see a proximal LAD occlusion on the angiogram, the entire team moves with urgency. Every minute matters — opening that artery quickly can mean the difference between recovery and death.\"</div><h3>Why Some People Have No Warning</h3><p>The atherosclerotic plaque may not cause significant narrowing until it ruptures — at which point a clot forms suddenly and completely occludes the vessel. This is why patients who seemed \"healthy\" can have catastrophic events. Advanced screening — coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring, coronary CT angiography — is gaining traction for identifying subclinical disease before disaster strikes.</p><h3>The Role of the Cath Lab</h3><p>The goal is door-to-balloon time of 90 minutes or less — from hospital arrival to opening the artery with balloon and stent. Systems of care — 24/7 cath lab activation, pre-hospital EKG transmission by paramedics, streamlined ER protocols — exist precisely because of this urgency. When performed rapidly, survival has improved dramatically versus the pre-PCI era.</p><h3>Survival and Recovery</h3><p>Patients who survive and receive prompt revascularization can achieve meaningful recovery of heart function. Left ventricular ejection fraction often improves significantly over weeks to months after reperfusion, especially when stunned but viable muscle recovers. Cardiac rehabilitation and evidence-based medications are critical to long-term outcomes.</p><div class=\"article-refs\"><div class=\"article-refs-title\">References</div><ol><li>Keeley EC, et al.

What makes it challenging is how subtly symptoms develop — often leading to significant delays in diagnosis.</p><h3>Symptoms — Subtle at First, Serious When Advanced</h3><p><strong>Shortness of breath</strong> — especially orthopnea (lying flat) and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (waking gasping) — is the hallmark. Patients often attribute it to \"being out of shape.\" If you've started sleeping with extra pillows because of breathing discomfort, tell your doctor.</p><p><strong>Leg swelling (edema)</strong> — particularly ankles — occurs when reduced cardiac output causes fluid to back up into tissues.

But there's a strong chance nobody has checked your Lp(a) — lipoprotein(a) — and that's a problem. Lp(a) is an independent, genetically determined cardiovascular risk factor present in about 20% of the population at significantly elevated levels. It's one of the most important cardiovascular risk factors we routinely fail to measure, and RNA-targeted therapies are now in late-stage clinical trials.</p><h3>What Is Lp(a) and Why Is It Different?</h3><p>Lipoprotein(a) is an LDL-like particle with an additional protein — apolipoprotein(a) — attached. Unlike standard LDL, Lp(a) levels are predominantly determined by genetics (the LPA gene), not diet or lifestyle. If your Lp(a) is elevated, no amount of dietary modification will substantially lower it. This genetic determination means it runs in families — if a first-degree relative had unexplained early heart disease, your Lp(a) should be measured.</p><div class=\"article-callout\">\"Lp(a) is the most common genetic cause of premature cardiovascular disease. It's present at birth, largely unchanged by lifestyle, and most patients have never had it measured. That needs to change.\"</div><h3>Why Is Elevated Lp(a) Dangerous?</h3><p>Elevated Lp(a) (above 50 mg/dL or above the 75th–80th percentile) significantly increases risk of heart attack, stroke, and calcific aortic stenosis. The risk is dose-dependent — the higher the level, the greater the risk. Lp(a) also has pro-thrombotic properties beyond its LDL-like atherogenic effects.</p><h3>Who Should Be Tested?</h3><p>The European Society of Cardiology recommends Lp(a) measurement at least once in every adult's lifetime. I measure it in patients with cardiovascular events despite well-controlled conventional risk factors, strong family history of early heart disease, premature atherosclerosis, and calcific aortic stenosis.</p><h3>A Treatment Revolution on the Horizon</h3><p>Statins don't meaningfully lower Lp(a). PCSK9 inhibitors reduce it by 20–30%. The exciting development: RNA-based therapies (pelacarsen — antisense oligonucleotide; olpasiran — siRNA) have shown 70–90% Lp(a) reduction in phase 2 trials. Phase 3 cardiovascular outcome trials are now enrolling. These could represent the first specific therapy for elevated Lp(a).

    "byline": "By Murtaza Bharmal, MD · Interventional Cardiologist · September 5, 2025",
    "body": "\n      <h3>The Question That Brings More People to the Emergency Room Than Almost Anything Else</h3>\n      <p>Chest pain is one of the most common reasons for emergency room visits and one of the most anxiety-provoking symptoms a person can experience. The question \"is this my heart?\" is entirely reasonable — and the answer, fortunately, is that cardiac causes represent a minority of chest pain presentations in general. But the minority that <em>is</em> cardiac can be life-threatening, which is why chest pain always deserves serious evaluation.</p>\n      <p>As an interventional cardiologist, I've seen the full spectrum — from patients convinced they were having a heart attack who had acid reflux, to patients who dismissed their chest discomfort as \"nothing\" and arrived in the cath lab with a major MI. Here's how I think about chest pain, and what you need to know.</p>\n\n      <h3>Cardiac Causes of Chest Pain — The Ones That Matter Most</h3>\n      <p><strong>Angina (stable and unstable):</strong> Angina is chest discomfort caused by reduced blood flow to the heart muscle — most often due to coronary artery disease. Stable angina is predictable: it occurs with exertion or stress, lasts minutes, and resolves with rest or nitroglycerin. Unstable angina is less predictable — it occurs at rest, with minimal exertion, or is new and worsening — and represents a medical emergency requiring immediate evaluation. Angina is classically described as pressure, squeezing, tightness, or a heavy weight on the chest, often radiating to the left arm, jaw, or back.</p>\n      <p><strong>Acute myocardial infarction (heart attack):</strong> Similar in quality to angina but typically more severe, prolonged (more than 20 minutes), and not relieved by rest. May be accompanied by sweating, nausea, shortness of breath, and a sense of doom. If you think you're having a heart attack, call 911 immediately.</p>\n      <p><strong>Aortic dissection:</strong> A tear in the aorta (the body's main artery) causes sudden, severe, \"ripping\" or \"tearing\" chest or back pain — one of the most dramatic emergencies in medicine. Risk factors include poorly controlled hypertension, bicuspid aortic valve, and Marfan syndrome.</p>\n      <p><strong>Pericarditis:</strong> Inflammation of the sac surrounding the heart causes sharp chest pain that's typically worse lying flat and improved by sitting up and leaning forward. Often viral in origin.</p>\n      <p><strong>Pulmonary embolism (PE):</strong> A blood clot in the lungs can cause pleuritic chest pain (sharp, worse with breathing or coughing) along with shortness of breath and rapid heart rate.</p>\n\n      <div class=\"article-callout\">\"Cardiac chest pain typically feels like pressure, squeezing, or heaviness — not sharp, stabbing, or positional. But the classic description misses significant presentations. When in doubt, get evaluated.\"</div>\n\n      <h3>Non-Cardiac Causes — The More Common Culprits</h3>\n      <p><strong>Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and esophageal spasm:</strong> GERD is among the most common causes of chest discomfort mistaken for cardiac pain. It can cause burning or pressure-like sensations in the chest, often after meals or when lying down. Esophageal spasm can mimic angina closely, even responding to nitroglycerin.</p>\n      <p><strong>Musculoskeletal pain:</strong> Costochondritis (inflammation of the cartilage connecting ribs to the sternum) and muscle strain cause chest pain that is typically sharp, reproducible with palpation or movement, and positional. This is among the most common causes of chest pain in younger adults.</p>\n      <p><strong>Anxiety and panic attacks:</strong> Chest tightness, palpitations, and shortness of breath are hallmarks of panic attacks and can closely mimic cardiac symptoms. Anxiety does not increase cardiovascular risk by itself in otherwise healthy patients — but if there's diagnostic uncertainty, cardiac evaluation is appropriate.</p>\n      <p><strong>Pleuritis:</strong> Inflammation of the lining of the lungs causes sharp pain that worsens with breathing or coughing.</p>\n\n      <h3>How Doctors Evaluate Chest Pain</h3>\n      <p>When you arrive with chest pain, the first priorities are an EKG (looking for ischemia, infarction, or arrhythmia) and cardiac troponin blood tests (which rise when heart muscle is damaged). A normal EKG and troponin do not rule out all cardiac causes — but they're reassuring starting points. Additional evaluation may include a stress test, echocardiogram, coronary CT angiography (CCTA), or cardiac catheterization depending on clinical suspicion.</p>\n\n      <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>\n      <p><strong>Is sharp chest pain cardiac?</strong> Sharp, stabbing chest pain that is reproduced by pressing on the chest or worsens with specific positions is less likely to be cardiac — cardiac pain is more typically pressure or squeezing. However, exceptions exist, and no chest pain should be dismissed without evaluation if you have cardiac risk factors.</p>\n      <p><strong>Can chest pain come and go for days without it being a heart attack?</strong> Intermittent chest discomfort over days can represent unstable angina, which requires prompt evaluation even without a completed heart attack. Don't wait to get this evaluated.</p>\n      <p><strong>When should I call 911 for chest pain?</strong> Call 911 for: chest pain lasting more than a few minutes, chest pain with shortness of breath, sweating, nausea or jaw/arm radiation, or any chest pain in someone with known heart disease. Don't drive yourself.</p>\n\n      <div class=\"article-refs\"><div class=\"article-refs-title\">References</div><ol>\n        <li>Swap CJ, Nagurney JT.

    "title": "Coronary Artery Calcium Score — The $100 Test That Could Save Your Life",
    "byline": "By Murtaza Bharmal, MD · Interventional Cardiologist · September 11, 2025",
    "body": "\n      <h3>The Most Underused Screening Test in Preventive Cardiology</h3>\n      <p>The coronary artery calcium (CAC) score is a non-invasive CT scan that measures the amount of calcified plaque in your coronary arteries. It takes about 10–15 minutes, costs as little as $100–150 at many centers (often not covered by insurance but accessible as a cash-pay test), uses no contrast dye, and provides more actionable cardiovascular risk information than almost any other single test available. Despite this, it remains dramatically underutilized. I order it regularly and think it should be standard of care for a specific subset of patients.</p>\n\n      <h3>What Does a Calcium Score Actually Tell You?</h3>\n      <p>The CAC score is expressed in Agatston units and ranges from 0 to over 1,000. A score of zero means no detectable calcified plaque — and is extraordinarily reassuring. A large body of evidence shows that a CAC score of 0 in intermediate-risk patients is associated with a very low 10-year cardiovascular event rate, effectively reclassifying these patients to low risk. A score of 1–99 indicates mild plaque, 100–399 moderate, and 400+ extensive coronary artery disease. Higher scores correlate directly with higher risk of heart attack and cardiovascular death.</p>\n      <p>Critically, the CAC score identifies disease that risk calculators miss. The most commonly used risk calculator — the ASCVD risk score — considers age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes, and smoking history. It doesn't know whether those risk factors have actually caused plaque in your specific arteries. The CAC scan does.</p>\n\n      <div class=\"article-callout\">\"I've had patients with 'borderline' risk scores who were on the fence about starting a statin. A CAC score of 320 settles that conversation immediately. And I've had patients with high predicted risk whose score of zero allowed us to defer medication and focus on lifestyle.\"</div>\n\n      <h3>Who Should Get a Calcium Score?</h3>\n      <p>Current ACC/AHA guidelines recommend CAC scoring in selected intermediate-risk patients (10-year ASCVD risk 7.5–20%) where the decision to start or intensify statin therapy is uncertain. I also find it particularly valuable in: patients who are reluctant to start a statin and want objective evidence of coronary artery disease; younger patients with strong family history of premature heart disease; patients who have stopped statins due to side effects and want to reassess their true risk; and patients with elevated Lp(a) or other genetic risk factors. CAC scoring is not recommended for low-risk patients (where the pretest probability doesn't justify even a low-dose CT) or for very high-risk patients who should already be treated maximally.</p>\n\n      <h3>Zero Is Powerful — But Not Forever</h3>\n      <p>A CAC score of 0 is associated with a favorable prognosis over the next 5–10 years but should not be interpreted as a permanent free pass. Plaque can accumulate over time, particularly in patients with ongoing risk factors like hypertension, smoking, or elevated LDL. Guidelines suggest rescoring every 5 years if a patient remains in an intermediate-risk category and risk factors are ongoing.</p>\n\n      <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>\n      <p><strong>Is a coronary calcium scan the same as a heart CT scan?</strong> A CAC scan is a specific type of cardiac CT that only measures calcified plaque. A coronary CT angiogram (CCTA) uses contrast dye and provides more information (including non-calcified plaque and vessel anatomy) but is more expensive and involves more radiation.</p>\n      <p><strong>Does a zero calcium score mean no heart disease?</strong> A score of 0 means no detectable <em>calcified</em> plaque. Non-calcified (soft) plaque cannot be detected by a CAC scan — which is why it doesn't completely rule out coronary artery disease, just significantly reduces the probability of obstructive disease in the near term.</p>\n      <p><strong>Does insurance cover a coronary calcium scan?</strong> Coverage varies significantly. Medicare covers CAC scanning in certain circumstances. Many private insurers do not. However, many imaging centers offer it as a cash-pay screening test for $75–150, making it highly accessible.</p>\n\n      <div class=\"article-refs\"><div class=\"article-refs-title\">References</div><ol>\n        <li>Grundy SM, et al. 2018 AHA/ACC Cholesterol Guideline. <em>J Am Coll Cardiol.</em> 2019;73(24):e285–e350.</li>\n        <li>Blaha MJ, et al.

    "title": "POTS Heart Disease — What Is Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome?",
    "byline": "By Murtaza Bharmal, MD · Interventional Cardiologist · September 17, 2025",
    "body": "\n      <h3>The Diagnosis That's Exploded in Search Volume — and Why It Matters</h3>\n      <p>POTS — postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome — is one of the most searched cardiovascular health topics on the internet, and its prominence has only grown since long COVID dramatically increased its prevalence and awareness. Despite being relatively common (affecting an estimated 1–3 million Americans), POTS remains widely misunderstood, frequently misdiagnosed, and often dismissed. Here's what every patient and clinician needs to know.</p>\n\n      <h3>What Is POTS?</h3>\n      <p>POTS is a form of dysautonomia — a disorder of the autonomic nervous system that regulates involuntary body functions including heart rate, blood pressure, and circulation. In POTS, the heart rate increases excessively upon standing (by 30 beats per minute or more within 10 minutes, in the absence of orthostatic hypotension). This abnormal heart rate response is the defining feature, but POTS is a multisystem disorder with a broad symptom spectrum that goes well beyond a racing heart.</p>\n      <p>It predominantly affects women (approximately 80% of cases) and typically presents between ages 15 and 50. It can be triggered by viral illness (including COVID-19), pregnancy, trauma, or surgery, and may occur in the context of other conditions including hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS), autoimmune disorders, and mast cell activation syndrome.</p>\n\n      <div class=\"article-callout\">\"POTS is not 'just anxiety.' It is a physiologically documented autonomic disorder with objective, measurable findings. Many patients wait years for diagnosis while being told their symptoms are psychological.\"</div>\n\n      <h3>Symptoms of POTS</h3>\n      <p>The hallmark symptom is lightheadedness, dizziness, or near-fainting upon standing — caused by blood pooling in the legs and insufficient venous return to the heart. But the symptom constellation is wide: rapid or pounding heartbeat (particularly upright), fatigue (often severe), brain fog and cognitive difficulties, exercise intolerance, headaches, nausea, temperature regulation problems, and in some cases, fainting (syncope). Symptoms are typically worse in the morning, after meals, in heat, and with prolonged standing.</p>\n\n      <h3>How Is POTS Diagnosed?</h3>\n      <p>The gold standard for diagnosis is the tilt table test, in which the patient is strapped to a table that tilts from horizontal to 70 degrees upright while heart rate and blood pressure are continuously monitored. A sustained heart rate increase of ≥30 bpm (≥40 bpm in adolescents) without significant blood pressure drop confirms the diagnosis. A more accessible alternative is the active stand test — measuring heart rate and blood pressure lying, then after 1, 5, and 10 minutes of standing. This can be done in a clinic or even at home with a validated monitor.</p>\n\n      <h3>Treatment — What Actually Helps</h3>\n      <p>POTS management is multimodal. Non-pharmacological interventions are first-line: aggressive hydration (2–3 liters of water and 10–12 grams of sodium daily), compression stockings or abdominal binders to reduce venous pooling, elevating the head of the bed, and a structured exercise program (starting recumbent — rowing, swimming, or cycling — then progressing to upright exercise as tolerated). Exercise rehabilitation is one of the most effective long-term interventions.</p>\n      <p>Pharmacological options include beta-blockers (propranolol, metoprolol) to control heart rate, fludrocortisone to increase blood volume, midodrine to increase vascular tone, and ivabradine (particularly effective for heart rate reduction in POTS with minimal blood pressure effects).

    "byline": "By Murtaza Bharmal, MD · Interventional Cardiologist · September 23, 2025",
    "body": "\n      <h3>Heart Disease Is the Leading Killer of Women — And It's Still Being Missed</h3>\n      <p>Heart disease kills more women than all cancers combined — more than breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and lung cancer put together. Yet surveys consistently show that fewer than half of American women correctly identify heart disease as their greatest health threat. Equally concerning: the medical community has historically studied and characterized heart disease primarily in men, leaving women's cardiovascular presentations under-recognized and undertreated. This is changing, but not fast enough.</p>\n      <p>Here's what women need to know — and what healthcare providers need to do better.</p>\n\n      <h3>How Heart Disease Presents Differently in Women</h3>\n      <p>The \"classic\" heart attack presentation — crushing central chest pain radiating to the left arm, with sweating and nausea — is less reliably present in women. Women are significantly more likely to present with atypical symptoms: unexplained fatigue (sometimes days before the cardiac event), shortness of breath without prominent chest pain, upper back or jaw pain, nausea and vomiting, and a vague sense that \"something is wrong.\" These presentations are more likely to be attributed to anxiety, GI problems, or musculoskeletal causes — by both patients and providers — leading to delayed care and worse outcomes.</p>\n      <p>Women also more commonly experience <strong>microvascular disease</strong> — narrowing of the small coronary arteries rather than the large epicardial arteries typically affected in men. This pattern, called ischemia with non-obstructive coronary artery disease (INOCA), can cause symptoms of angina but produces normal or near-normal results on traditional coronary angiography, leading to frequent misdiagnosis and the incorrect reassurance that \"your arteries are clear.\"</p>\n\n      <div class=\"article-callout\">\"When a woman comes to the ER with fatigue, jaw pain, and shortness of breath — and her ECG looks normal — it's easy to miss the heart attack. We have to maintain a higher index of suspicion and use the right diagnostic tools.\"</div>\n\n      <h3>Risk Factors Unique to or More Powerful in Women</h3>\n      <p><strong>Pregnancy complications</strong> that predict future cardiovascular risk: preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, preterm delivery, and pregnancy loss are now recognized as powerful independent cardiac risk factors. A woman who had preeclampsia has 4x the risk of heart failure and 2x the risk of heart attack compared to women with uncomplicated pregnancies. These histories should be documented and used in risk stratification — but often aren't.</p>\n      <p><strong>Early menopause</strong> (before age 40–45) is associated with higher cardiovascular risk, likely due to the loss of cardioprotective estrogen effects. Women who undergo surgical menopause have particularly elevated risk.</p>\n      <p><strong>Autoimmune diseases</strong> — rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and psoriasis — disproportionately affect women and significantly accelerate atherosclerosis. Cardiovascular risk assessment in women with these conditions should be more aggressive.</p>\n      <p><strong>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)</strong> is associated with insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and elevated cardiovascular risk — yet is rarely flagged as a cardiac risk factor in clinical practice.</p>\n\n      <h3>Gaps in Treatment</h3>\n      <p>Studies have consistently documented that women are less likely to be referred for cardiac catheterization, less likely to receive evidence-based post-MI medications, and less likely to be enrolled in cardiac rehabilitation than men — even after adjustment for clinical characteristics. Closing these gaps requires awareness at both the patient and provider level.</p>\n\n      <h3>What Women Should Do</h3>\n      <p>Know your numbers — blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar, and BMI. Report cardiovascular symptoms even when they're atypical. Tell your cardiologist about pregnancy complications, menopause timing, and autoimmune history. Ask specifically about coronary microvascular disease if you have symptoms without obstructive coronary artery disease on angiography. Advocate for yourself if you feel dismissed.</p>\n\n      <div class=\"article-refs\"><div class=\"article-refs-title\">References</div><ol>\n        <li>Mehta LS, et al.

    "byline": "By Murtaza Bharmal, MD · Interventional Cardiologist · September 29, 2025",
    "body": "\n      <h3>One of the Most Important Decisions in Cardiovascular Medicine</h3>\n      <p>When a patient is found to have significant coronary artery disease, one of the most consequential conversations in medicine begins: stent (percutaneous coronary intervention, or PCI) or bypass surgery (coronary artery bypass grafting, or CABG)? As an interventional cardiologist, I perform PCI — but I work closely with cardiac surgeons, and the right answer is always driven by the evidence and the patient's anatomy, not by who's doing the procedure.</p>\n\n      <h3>What Is a Coronary Stent (PCI)?</h3>\n      <p>Percutaneous coronary intervention involves threading a catheter through the femoral artery in the groin or the radial artery in the wrist to the coronary arteries. A balloon is inflated to compress the blockage, and a metallic mesh tube (stent) — almost always a drug-eluting stent — is deployed to keep the artery open. The procedure is typically done under local anesthesia with sedation, takes 1–2 hours, and most patients go home within 24 hours. Recovery is measured in days.</p>\n\n      <h3>What Is Bypass Surgery (CABG)?</h3>\n      <p>Coronary artery bypass grafting uses vessels harvested from elsewhere in the body — typically the left internal mammary artery (LIMA) and veins from the leg — to reroute blood flow around blocked coronary arteries, literally creating new pathways. It requires general anesthesia, a median sternotomy (opening the chest), typically 4–6 days of hospitalization, and 6–12 weeks of recovery. The LIMA-to-LAD (left anterior descending) bypass is particularly durable — the gold standard for long-term patency.</p>\n\n      <div class=\"article-callout\">\"PCI is faster and less invasive. Bypass surgery, in the right patient, provides more complete revascularization and superior long-term outcomes for complex multivessel disease. This decision requires honest conversation between the patient, cardiologist, and surgeon.\"</div>\n\n      <h3>The Evidence — When Each Is Preferred</h3>\n      <p><strong>Single-vessel disease (one blocked artery):</strong> PCI is generally preferred when feasible. The outcomes are equivalent to CABG in most single-vessel scenarios, and PCI's lower procedural risk and faster recovery make it the logical choice.</p>\n      <p><strong>Two-vessel disease:</strong> Often treated with PCI, particularly if the LAD is not involved. CABG may be preferred in specific anatomical situations.</p>\n      <p><strong>Three-vessel disease or left main disease:</strong> This is where the decision becomes most important. The SYNTAX trial and subsequent studies showed that in patients with complex three-vessel or left main disease — particularly with high SYNTAX scores (a measure of coronary complexity) — CABG provides better long-term freedom from repeat revascularization and may provide mortality benefit, especially in diabetic patients. The EXCEL and NOBLE trials for left main disease showed mixed results, with ongoing debate, but most guidelines support CABG as the preferred option for complex left main disease in good surgical candidates.</p>\n      <p><strong>Diabetic patients:</strong> Multiple trials (including FREEDOM) have shown that diabetic patients with multivessel disease derive greater survival benefit from CABG than PCI. This is a consistent finding that influences decisions significantly.</p>\n      <p><strong>Acute heart attack (STEMI):</strong> PCI is the treatment of choice — there's no time for surgery when minutes matter.</p>\n\n      <h3>The Heart Team</h3>\n      <p>Complex coronary artery disease decisions should be made by a \"heart team\" — including the interventional cardiologist, cardiac surgeon, and the patient — rather than by a single operator working in isolation. I take this seriously. When a patient has anatomy better suited for surgery, I refer to surgery. The goal is the patient's best outcome, not procedural volume.</p>\n\n      <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>\n      <p><strong>How long does a stent last?</strong> Modern drug-eluting stents are highly durable. In-stent restenosis (re-narrowing) occurs in roughly 5–10% of stents within the first year, dropping significantly thereafter. Stents don't have a fixed \"expiration date\" — the limiting factor is progression of disease in other vessels over time.</p>\n      <p><strong>Can I have bypass surgery if I've already had stents?</strong> Yes. Prior stenting does not preclude bypass surgery, though it can complicate surgical planning.</p>\n      <p><strong>What is the recovery time for bypass surgery?</strong> Most patients are discharged in 4–6 days and return to normal activities within 6–12 weeks. Sternal healing is the primary limiting factor.</p>\n\n      <div class=\"article-refs\"><div class=\"article-refs-title\">References</div><ol>\n        <li>Serruys PW, et al.

    "byline": "By Murtaza Bharmal, MD · Interventional Cardiologist · October 3, 2025",
    "body": "\n      <h3>The Question Every Patient With a Cardiac Diagnosis Asks</h3>\n      <p>\"Can I reverse this?\" It's among the most common questions I hear from patients newly diagnosed with coronary artery disease or after a cardiac event. The honest, evidence-based answer is nuanced — and more hopeful than many expect, with some important caveats.</p>\n\n      <h3>What \"Reversing\" Heart Disease Means</h3>\n      <p>Coronary artery disease results from the buildup of atherosclerotic plaque in the coronary arteries over decades. This process involves lipid deposition, inflammation, and structural changes in the arterial wall. \"Reversal\" can mean different things: shrinking existing plaque, stabilizing plaque to prevent rupture (which causes heart attacks), stopping disease progression, or restoring normal arterial function.</p>\n      <p>The evidence is strongest for the latter three — particularly plaque stabilization and halting progression. True anatomical plaque regression (measurable shrinkage) requires aggressive, sustained LDL lowering but has been demonstrated in well-designed imaging studies.</p>\n\n      <div class=\"article-callout\">\"You may not be able to completely undo decades of plaque buildup — but you absolutely can stop it from progressing and dramatically reduce your risk of a heart attack going forward. That's what matters clinically.\"</div>\n\n      <h3>Plaque Regression — What the Imaging Trials Show</h3>\n      <p>Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) studies — which measure coronary plaque volume directly inside the vessel — have shown that intensive lipid lowering produces measurable plaque regression. The ASTEROID trial showed statistically significant plaque reduction with high-dose rosuvastatin when LDL was lowered to a mean of 60 mg/dL. The GLAGOV trial added evolocumab (a PCSK9 inhibitor) to statin therapy and showed further plaque regression, with 64% of patients achieving plaque volume reduction — compared to 47% on statin alone. The key message: the lower the LDL, the greater the regression. This is why very aggressive lipid lowering (LDL below 55–70 mg/dL) is now guideline-recommended for patients with established cardiovascular disease.</p>\n\n      <h3>Diet and Lifestyle — The Ornish Evidence</h3>\n      <p>Dean Ornish's landmark research demonstrated that an intensive lifestyle program — very low-fat plant-based diet, regular aerobic exercise, stress management, and social support — produced angiographically measurable regression of coronary lesions in a small but carefully studied group of patients. This remains compelling proof-of-concept that lifestyle can reverse plaque. The challenge is that the Ornish program is extremely demanding — few patients can sustain it long-term — and the magnitude of benefit was modest compared to what's achievable with intensive pharmacotherapy.</p>\n\n      <h3>Plaque Stabilization — Perhaps More Important Than Regression</h3>\n      <p>Heart attacks occur when plaque ruptures, not when it's simply present. A stabilized, calcified plaque — even a large one — is less dangerous than a smaller, lipid-rich, inflamed \"vulnerable\" plaque. Statins, independent of their LDL-lowering effect, reduce plaque inflammation and promote a stable fibrous cap. This plaque-stabilizing effect may explain a significant portion of statins' cardiovascular benefit — and it occurs even without complete plaque regression. Risk reduction can be dramatic even when plaques remain anatomically present.</p>\n\n      <h3>What I Tell My Patients</h3>\n      <p>Complete erasure of decades of atherosclerosis is not realistic for most people. But meaningful risk reduction — equivalent to what most patients hope for when they ask about \"reversal\" — absolutely is. The prescription: maximize LDL reduction (often requiring high-intensity statin plus ezetimibe and/or PCSK9 inhibition), optimize blood pressure and blood sugar, stop smoking, follow a Mediterranean-style diet, exercise regularly, and attend cardiac rehabilitation if appropriate. This approach can bend the curve of cardiovascular risk dramatically. That, in my view, is the achievable goal.</p>\n\n      <div class=\"article-refs\"><div class=\"article-refs-title\">References</div><ol>\n        <li>Nissen SE, et al.

    "byline": "By Murtaza Bharmal, MD · Interventional Cardiologist · October 9, 2025",
    "body": "\n      <h3>An Aneurysm Can Be Present for Decades Before Anything Happens — Then Be Suddenly Fatal</h3>\n      <p>An aortic aneurysm is an abnormal bulging or ballooning of the aorta — the body's largest artery, which carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body. The two most common locations are the abdominal aorta (abdominal aortic aneurysm, or AAA) and the thoracic aorta, including the ascending aorta near the heart (thoracic aortic aneurysm, or TAA). Most aortic aneurysms are completely silent until they rupture or dissect — events that carry mortality rates exceeding 50–80% and often leave no time for treatment.</p>\n\n      <h3>Who Is at Risk?</h3>\n      <p>Risk factors for AAA include age over 65, male sex (AAA is 5–6x more common in men), tobacco use (by far the strongest modifiable risk factor — smoking dramatically accelerates aneurysm growth), hypertension, atherosclerosis, and family history (a first-degree male relative with AAA roughly doubles your risk). Risk factors for thoracic aortic aneurysm overlap but also include bicuspid aortic valve, connective tissue disorders (Marfan syndrome, Loeys-Dietz syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome), and certain inflammatory conditions.</p>\n\n      <div class=\"article-callout\">\"Most patients with an aortic aneurysm have no symptoms whatsoever until rupture or dissection. Screening is the only way to find it before that happens — and for AAA, a one-time ultrasound screen in the right population literally saves lives.\"</div>\n\n      <h3>Screening — Who Should Get It?</h3>\n      <p>The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends one-time abdominal ultrasound screening for AAA in <strong>men aged 65–75 who have ever smoked</strong> (defined as ≥100 cigarettes lifetime). This is a Grade B recommendation, meaning it is covered by insurance without cost-sharing. Women who have ever smoked and men who have never smoked fall in the \"selective screening\" category — the decision should be individualized based on risk factors. For thoracic aneurysms, there is no equivalent population-based screening program, though patients with bicuspid aortic valves, connective tissue disorders, or family history should have echocardiographic and/or CT surveillance.</p>\n\n      <h3>Management — Watchful Waiting vs. Intervention</h3>\n      <p>Small aneurysms are monitored with regular imaging. AAAs under 5.0–5.5 cm (men) or 4.5–5.0 cm (women) are typically managed conservatively — blood pressure control, smoking cessation (the most impactful intervention to slow growth), and periodic imaging surveillance. Once an AAA reaches threshold size, or grows rapidly (more than 0.5 cm in 6 months), or becomes symptomatic, repair is recommended. Options are open surgical repair or endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) — a minimally invasive approach using a catheter-delivered stent-graft that has become the predominant technique and is associated with lower 30-day mortality compared to open surgery.</p>\n\n      <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>\n      <p><strong>What does an aortic aneurysm feel like?</strong> Most aortic aneurysms feel like nothing — they are asymptomatic. When symptoms do occur, they may include a deep, gnawing abdominal or back pain, pulsating sensation in the abdomen, or pain in the flanks. Any sudden severe abdominal or back pain in a known or suspected aneurysm patient is an emergency.</p>\n      <p><strong>Can an aortic aneurysm go away on its own?</strong> No. Aortic aneurysms do not regress spontaneously. The goals of management are to slow growth and prevent rupture.</p>\n      <p><strong>Is aortic aneurysm hereditary?</strong> Yes, there is a significant familial component. First-degree relatives (especially male siblings) of a person with AAA should discuss screening with their physician.</p>\n\n      <div class=\"article-refs\"><div class=\"article-refs-title\">References</div><ol>\n        <li>Chaikof EL, et al.

    "body": "\n      <h3>The Event That Stops the Sports World — And What's Behind It</h3>\n      <p>Few events generate more public fear and media coverage than a young athlete collapsing during competition. Damar Hamlin's cardiac arrest on the NFL field in January 2023 triggered a nationwide conversation about sudden cardiac death in athletes — and brought long-overdue attention to the conditions that cause it, the sports cardiac screening debate, and the critical importance of rapid bystander response. As a cardiologist, I want to address the science behind these events and what athletes, parents, and coaches should know.</p>\n\n      <h3>How Common Is Sudden Cardiac Death in Athletes?</h3>\n      <p>Sudden cardiac death (SCD) in athletes is rare but not exceedingly so. Estimates vary widely depending on methodology and population, but U.S. data suggest approximately 1 in 50,000 to 1 in 80,000 high school athletes per year. College athletes have higher rates, around 1 in 43,000. The absolute numbers are small — but given the devastating nature of the event and the young age of those affected, prevention and response optimization are imperative.</p>\n\n      <h3>The Most Common Underlying Causes</h3>\n      <p><strong>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)</strong> is the most commonly identified cause of SCD in young athletes in the United States, accounting for approximately 35–40% of cases. HCM causes abnormal thickening of the heart muscle (particularly the left ventricle), creating electrical instability and outflow obstruction. Most affected individuals have no symptoms and no family history. Many live normal lives — but intense athletic competition can trigger lethal ventricular arrhythmias.</p>\n      <p><strong>Commotio cordis</strong> — as in Damar Hamlin's case — occurs when a direct blow to the chest during a vulnerable phase of the cardiac cycle triggers ventricular fibrillation, even without structural heart damage. It's most common in baseball, hockey, and lacrosse.</p>\n      <p><strong>Anomalous coronary artery origin</strong> — when a coronary artery originates from an abnormal location, it may become compressed during exercise, causing ischemia and arrhythmia.</p>\n      <p><strong>Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM/ARVC)</strong> causes fibrofatty replacement of right ventricular muscle, creating arrhythmia substrates. Notably, exercise accelerates disease progression — and is why competitive sports restriction is recommended in confirmed cases.</p>\n      <p><strong>Long QT syndrome, Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW), Brugada syndrome</strong> — genetic ion channel disorders that create electrical instability without structural heart disease.</p>\n      <p><strong>Myocarditis</strong> — viral inflammation of the heart muscle, which became particularly prominent post-COVID — is an important and treatable cause of exercise-related arrhythmia and death.</p>\n\n      <div class=\"article-callout\">\"The most impactful things we can do for sudden cardiac death in sports: have AEDs everywhere athletes compete, train everyone in CPR and AED use, and develop better screening strategies for the highest-risk conditions.\"</div>\n\n      <h3>Warning Signs That Should Never Be Ignored</h3>\n      <p>These symptoms in an athlete require prompt cardiac evaluation — not reassurance that \"it's just the sport\": unexplained fainting or near-fainting during or after exertion; chest pain or pressure during exercise; unexpected shortness of breath out of proportion to exertion; palpitations or sensation of a racing heart during activity; and a family history of sudden cardiac death under age 50 in a first-degree relative.</p>\n\n      <h3>Pre-Participation Screening — The Ongoing Debate</h3>\n      <p>Current U.S. practice relies on the AHA 14-element history and physical examination for pre-participation cardiovascular screening. Europe and Italy have used universal 12-lead ECG screening with evidence of reduced SCD rates. The ACC/AHA does not currently recommend universal ECG screening for all competitive athletes, citing concerns about false-positive rates and resource requirements — but ECG is recommended for athletes with positive findings on history and physical. The debate continues and evolves.</p>\n\n      <h3>AEDs Save Lives — Know Where They Are</h3>\n      <p>When SCD occurs on the field, the chain of survival — call 911, start CPR, use an AED immediately — is the only thing that saves lives before EMS arrives. In Hamlin's case, immediate CPR and defibrillation on the field were decisive. AEDs should be present at every athletic facility, and coaches, athletic trainers, and ideally all athletes should be trained in their use.</p>\n\n      <div class=\"article-refs\"><div class=\"article-refs-title\">References</div><ol>\n        <li>Maron BJ, et al.

    "body": "\n      <h3>What a Cardiologist's Shopping List Actually Looks Like</h3>\n      <p>\"What should I eat for my heart?\" is one of the most common questions I receive — and one of the most answerable ones in all of cardiology. The evidence on diet and cardiovascular disease is not as contradictory as food headlines suggest. The core principles are consistent across the highest-quality evidence and have been stable for decades. Here's a practical, specific guide to what to eat, what to limit, and why.</p>\n\n      <h3>The Foundation: What to Eat More Of</h3>\n      <p><strong>Vegetables and fruits — the non-negotiable foundation.</strong> Aim for 5–9 servings per day. Leafy greens (spinach, kale, arugula), cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, Brussels sprouts), berries (blueberries, strawberries, raspberries), and citrus fruits are particularly nutrient-dense. The antioxidants, fiber, potassium, and folate in these foods reduce blood pressure, inflammation, and oxidative stress. No supplement adequately replaces food.</p>\n      <p><strong>Whole grains.</strong> Oats, barley, quinoa, brown rice, and whole wheat provide soluble fiber that actively lowers LDL cholesterol. A bowl of oatmeal daily can reduce LDL by 5–10 mg/dL through beta-glucan fiber. Choose whole grains over refined — refined grains have had most of their fiber and nutrients removed.</p>\n      <p><strong>Legumes.</strong> Beans, lentils, chickpeas, and other legumes are extraordinarily heart-healthy — high in fiber, plant protein, and potassium, low in saturated fat, and associated with reduced blood pressure and LDL. The Blue Zone populations (some of the longest-lived people on earth) consume legumes daily.</p>\n      <p><strong>Fatty fish.</strong> Salmon, mackerel, sardines, herring, and tuna (particularly albacore) provide long-chain omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA) that reduce triglycerides, lower blood pressure, reduce inflammation, and decrease arrhythmia risk. Aim for at least two servings per week. If you don't eat fish, ask your doctor about prescription omega-3 (icosapentaenoic acid) supplementation.</p>\n      <p><strong>Nuts and seeds.</strong> Walnuts (particularly high in plant-based omega-3s), almonds, pistachios, flaxseed, and chia seeds all have significant cardiovascular benefit. The PREDIMED trial showed that adding a daily handful of nuts to a Mediterranean diet reduced cardiovascular events by 28%. A handful (about 1 oz) per day is the evidence-based dose.</p>\n      <p><strong>Olive oil.</strong> The cornerstone fat of the Mediterranean diet. Extra virgin olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids and polyphenols with anti-inflammatory properties. Replace saturated fats (butter, lard, coconut oil) with olive oil wherever possible.</p>\n\n      <div class=\"article-callout\">\"If I had to summarize a cardiac diet in one sentence: eat more plants, more fish, more nuts and olive oil, and fewer processed foods, refined grains, added sugars, and red meat.\"</div>\n\n      <h3>What to Limit or Avoid</h3>\n      <p><strong>Saturated fat</strong> — found in red meat, full-fat dairy, butter, coconut oil, and palm oil — raises LDL cholesterol. Current AHA guidelines recommend less than 6% of daily calories from saturated fat for those needing LDL reduction. Replacing saturated with unsaturated fat reduces cardiovascular risk meaningfully.</p>\n      <p><strong>Trans fat</strong> — partially hydrogenated vegetable oil — is the worst dietary fat for cardiovascular health, raising LDL while lowering HDL. The FDA has largely eliminated artificial trans fats from the U.S. food supply, but small amounts remain in some processed foods. Check labels for \"partially hydrogenated oil.\"</p>\n      <p><strong>Ultra-processed foods</strong> — packaged snacks, fast food, processed meats (bacon, hot dogs, deli meat), sugary beverages, and most prepared meals — are associated with higher cardiovascular mortality in multiple large observational studies, independent of their specific nutrient content.</p>\n      <p><strong>Sodium</strong> — the AHA recommends less than 2,300 mg per day (ideally below 1,500 mg for those with hypertension). Most Americans consume over 3,400 mg daily, primarily from processed and restaurant foods, not from the salt shaker.</p>\n      <p><strong>Added sugar</strong> — drives triglyceride elevation, promotes insulin resistance, and contributes to obesity. Limit sugary beverages (soda, juice, sweetened coffee drinks), sweets, and processed foods with added sugar as an ingredient.</p>\n\n      <h3>The Practical Bottom Line</h3>\n      <p>The Mediterranean dietary pattern — abundantly studied, consistently protective — provides the most accessible real-world framework: base meals on vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, and olive oil; eat fish twice a week; include nuts daily; limit red meat; and avoid ultra-processed foods. You don't need a perfect diet — consistent good choices over years is what moves the cardiovascular risk needle.</p>\n\n      <div class=\"article-refs\"><div class=\"article-refs-title\">References</div><ol>\n        <li>Estruch R, et al.

    "byline": "By Murtaza Bharmal, MD · Interventional Cardiologist · October 27, 2025",
    "body": "\n      <h3>What Patients Don't Know — And What Makes a Difference</h3>\n      <p>For many patients, a referral to a cardiologist triggers anxiety. What will they find? Will I need a procedure? What should I tell them? The uncertainty is understandable — and I've found that patients who come prepared have significantly better first visits. They ask better questions, retain more information, and leave with a clearer understanding of their situation. Here's exactly what to expect and how to prepare.</p>\n\n      <h3>Why You Might Be Referred to a Cardiologist</h3>\n      <p>Common reasons for a cardiology referral include: abnormal EKG findings on a routine exam or hospital workup; chest pain or pressure; shortness of breath on exertion; palpitations (irregular or rapid heartbeat); elevated blood pressure not well controlled on medication; elevated cholesterol, particularly with other risk factors; heart murmur; family history of early heart disease or sudden cardiac death; pre-operative cardiac evaluation before major surgery; or follow-up after a cardiac event (heart attack, arrhythmia, heart failure).</p>\n\n      <h3>What to Bring to Your Appointment</h3>\n      <p>The quality of your first visit depends enormously on the information you bring. Prepare: a complete medication list (including supplements and doses); prior EKGs if available; recent lab results (lipid panel, blood pressure readings, blood sugar/HbA1c); records from any prior cardiac evaluations, echocardiograms, or stress tests; a summary of your symptoms — when they started, what triggers them, what makes them better or worse; and your complete cardiac and medical history including any prior procedures or hospitalizations.</p>\n      <p>Critically: bring or report your <strong>family history</strong>. Specifically: any first-degree relatives (parents, siblings, children) with heart disease before age 55 in males or 65 in females; sudden cardiac death in a family member at any age; familial hypercholesterolemia; or aortic aneurysm.</p>\n\n      <div class=\"article-callout\">\"The single biggest thing patients can do to improve their cardiology visit: bring a complete medication list and know your family history. These two pieces of information change clinical decisions more than almost anything else.\"</div>\n\n      <h3>What Happens at the Visit</h3>\n      <p>A first cardiology visit typically includes a thorough medical history, a focused cardiovascular physical examination (listening to heart and lung sounds, assessing pulses, checking for jugular venous distension and leg edema), and a review of prior records and test results. An EKG is often obtained at the visit if a recent one isn't available. Based on what's found, your cardiologist may order additional tests — commonly an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart), a stress test, or laboratory work. More specialized testing — Holter monitor, coronary CT angiography, cardiac catheterization — is ordered when there's clinical reason for it.</p>\n\n      <h3>Questions to Ask Your Cardiologist</h3>\n      <p>Come with these questions written down: What do you think is causing my symptoms? What tests do I need, and why? What does my cardiovascular risk look like over the next 10 years? Should I be on medications — and if so, what are the benefits and risks? What lifestyle changes would make the most difference for my situation? How often should I be seen? Are there any symptoms I should watch for and respond to urgently? Is there anything in my family history I should be aware of?</p>\n\n      <h3>Local and Orange County Cardiology Patients</h3>\n      <p>I see patients at Providence St. Jude Medical Center in Fullerton, California, and practice interventional and preventive cardiology throughout Orange County and Southern California. If you've been referred to cardiology or have questions about your cardiovascular health, I welcome the opportunity to provide a thorough evaluation. My approach: evidence-based medicine, clear communication, and shared decision-making — always with the patient's goals at the center.</p>\n\n      <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>\n      <p><strong>Do I need a referral to see a cardiologist?</strong> This depends on your insurance plan. Many PPO plans allow direct access to specialists. HMO and some other plans require a primary care referral. Check with your insurance before scheduling.</p>\n      <p><strong>What is the difference between a cardiologist and an interventional cardiologist?</strong> General cardiologists diagnose and medically manage heart conditions. Interventional cardiologists have additional training in catheter-based procedures — coronary angiography, stent placement, and structural heart interventions like TAVR. Not all cardiology problems require an interventional cardiologist, but complex coronary artery disease, heart attacks, and structural heart disease usually do.</p>\n      <p><strong>How long will my first cardiology appointment take?</strong> A thorough first visit typically takes 45–60 minutes. If you have a complex history, allow more time.</p>\n\n      <div class=\"article-refs\"><div class=\"article-refs-title\">References</div><ol>\n        <li>Arnett DK, et al. 2019 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease. <em>Circulation.</em> 2019;140(11):e596–e646.</li>\n        <li>American Heart Association.

    "title": "Ramadan & Heart Health — Your Top 10 Questions Answered",
    "byline": "By Murtaza Bharmal, MD · Interventional Cardiologist · February 22, 2026",
    "body": "<p>Ramadan brings a unique set of cardiovascular questions that don't always get answered in a standard clinic visit. Can I safely fast? Do I need to change my medications? What should I eat? When should I worry? Below are the ten questions I hear most often, answered with the best available clinical evidence.</p>\n\n<h3>Q1: Is it safe to fast during Ramadan if I have heart disease?</h3>\n<p>For most patients with stable cardiovascular disease, the evidence is reassuring. Multiple systematic reviews have found no significant increase in acute cardiac events — heart attacks, strokes, or heart failure hospitalizations — during Ramadan in stable patients compared to non-fasting months.</p>\n<p>The word \"stable\" matters a great deal here. Expert consensus guidelines divide cardiac patients into two groups:</p>\n<p><strong>Low or moderate risk (fasting generally safe):</strong> stable angina, controlled hypertension, history of heart attack more than 3 months prior, mild-to-moderate heart failure (NYHA Class I–II), and controlled AFib on anticoagulation.</p>\n<p><strong>High or very high risk (should not fast without close medical supervision):</strong> recent heart attack or unstable angina within 3 months, poorly controlled arrhythmias, advanced heart failure (NYHA Class III–IV), Long QT or Brugada syndrome, recent cardiac surgery, and severe uncontrolled hypertension.</p>\n<p>The Quran itself exempts those for whom fasting would cause harm. Following your cardiologist's guidance — including not fasting if advised — is entirely consistent with Islamic teaching.</p>\n\n<h3>Q2: How do I manage my heart medications during Ramadan?</h3>\n<p>Medication timing during a long daily fast requires careful adjustment. The guidance below covers the main categories — always confirm specific changes with your physician before modifying your regimen.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Once-daily medications</strong> (most statins, beta-blockers, ARBs, ACE inhibitors): shift to Iftar or Suhoor as directed by your physician.</li>\n<li><strong>Twice-daily medications:</strong> can often be shifted to Iftar and Suhoor. Never double up doses to compensate for a missed one.</li>\n<li><strong>Diuretics</strong> (furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide): taking these mid-fast worsens dehydration significantly. Most patients shift to Iftar; your physician may also reduce the dose temporarily.</li>\n<li><strong>Warfarin:</strong> dietary changes during Ramadan can destabilize INR. Monitor weekly if possible and report out-of-range values promptly.</li>\n<li><strong>DOACs</strong> (apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran): adjust timing to Iftar and Suhoor. Do not skip doses.</li>\n<li><strong>Antiplatelets</strong> (aspirin, clopidogrel): take with the Iftar meal to reduce gastric irritation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Never stop or adjust cardiac medications without speaking to your cardiologist first.</p>\n\n<h3>Q3: Will fasting cause dehydration that harms my heart?</h3>\n<p>Dehydration is the most significant physiological risk of Ramadan fasting for cardiac patients. Unlike other forms of intermittent fasting, Ramadan is a dry fast — no water during daylight hours. Significant dehydration thickens the blood, raises clot risk, lowers blood pressure, triggers electrolyte abnormalities that can cause arrhythmias, and increases heart rate.</p>\n<p>The strategy is maximizing hydration between Iftar and Suhoor. Aim for 8 to 10 glasses of water spread across the evening — not consumed all at once. Avoid excess caffeine, which acts as a diuretic. Include water-rich foods at both meals. Patients on diuretics are at the highest risk and should speak with their physician about dose adjustments before Ramadan begins.</p>\n\n<h3>Q4: What should I eat at Suhoor and Iftar to protect my heart?</h3>\n<p><strong>Suhoor:</strong> Focus on slow-digesting foods that sustain energy through the day — whole grains (oats, whole wheat), lean protein (eggs, lentils, yogurt), fruits and vegetables, and plenty of water. Avoid high-sodium foods, which worsen fluid retention and elevate blood pressure throughout the fasting hours.</p>\n<p><strong>Iftar:</strong> Break the fast with dates and water as is traditional, then pause before the main meal. The biggest cardiac risk at Iftar is the feast itself — deep-fried foods, high-sodium dishes, and sugary drinks are common and all worsen cardiovascular risk. Focus on grilled protein, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains. A full day of fasting's metabolic benefits are easily undone by a high-fat, high-salt Iftar.</p>\n\n<h3>Q5: Can Ramadan fasting actually benefit my heart?</h3>\n<p>Yes — and this point deserves more attention than it typically gets. For stable, well-managed patients, Ramadan fasting has been associated with several real cardiovascular benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improved lipid profiles, including lower LDL cholesterol and triglycerides</li>\n<li>Lower blood pressure, supported by a 2021 Journal of the American Heart Association study</li>\n<li>Modest weight loss that reduces cardiac workload</li>\n<li>Reduced inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein</li>\n<li>Smoking reduction in many patients, providing immediate cardiovascular benefit</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These benefits depend entirely on eating well during the non-fasting window. A careful fast followed by an unhealthy feast erases the gains.</p>\n\n<h3>Q6: I have high blood pressure. Should I fast?</h3>\n<p>Well-controlled hypertension alone is generally not a contraindication to Ramadan fasting. Studies consistently show blood pressure does not worsen significantly in well-managed patients — some even show modest improvement during the month. Key actions during Ramadan:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shift antihypertensive medications to Iftar and/or Suhoor as directed</li>\n<li>Strictly limit sodium at Iftar meals</li>\n<li>Maintain good hydration during non-fasting hours</li>\n<li>Monitor blood pressure at home and keep a log</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Patients with severe or uncontrolled hypertension — consistently above 180/110 mmHg — should not fast without explicit medical clearance.</p>\n\n<h3>Q7: I have atrial fibrillation and take a blood thinner. Is fasting safe?</h3>\n<p>AFib patients on anticoagulation can generally fast safely with the right precautions. Hydration is especially critical — dehydration increases clot risk, which is particularly relevant in AFib where clot formation in the left atrial appendage is the primary stroke mechanism.</p>\n<p>Warfarin patients should monitor INR weekly during Ramadan given shifts in diet. DOAC patients (apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran) should adjust timing to Iftar and Suhoor and never skip doses — even one missed dose meaningfully raises stroke risk in AFib. If you take antiarrhythmic medications, confirm the timing with your cardiologist, as these have narrow therapeutic windows where dosing schedule matters.</p>\n\n<h3>Q8: How much exercise is safe during Ramadan?</h3>\n<p>Light-to-moderate physical activity is safe and beneficial during Ramadan. Tarawih prayers — performed nightly — constitute meaningful physical activity in themselves, and studies show patients who regularly attend have greater reductions in weight and metabolic markers compared to those who do not.</p>\n<p>For cardiac patients, timing matters more than intensity. Avoid exercise during peak fasting hours when dehydration and low blood sugar risk are highest. The safest windows are 1 to 2 hours after Iftar, once you have eaten and rehydrated, or just before Suhoor. Stop immediately if you experience chest pain, significant shortness of breath, palpitations, or dizziness.</p>\n\n<h3>Q9: What warning signs should make me break my fast immediately?</h3>\n<p>Islamic jurisprudence is clear: preserving life takes precedence over fasting. Breaking the fast for medical necessity is not only permitted — it is the correct choice. Seek care immediately and break the fast for any of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chest pain or pressure, especially radiating to the arm, jaw, or back</li>\n<li>Severe shortness of breath at rest</li>\n<li>Sustained rapid or irregular heartbeat, particularly with dizziness</li>\n<li>Fainting or near-fainting</li>\n<li>Sudden severe headache, vision changes, facial drooping, or arm weakness — call 911 immediately</li>\n<li>Blood pressure reading above 180/110 mmHg</li>\n<li>Rapid weight gain (2 or more pounds in a single day) in heart failure patients</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Do not wait to see if symptoms resolve on their own. Call 911 for chest pain or stroke symptoms without delay.</p>\n\n<h3>Q10: Should I see my cardiologist about Ramadan fasting?</h3>\n<p>A brief pre-Ramadan cardiology visit — ideally 2 to 4 weeks before the month begins — to review medication timing and confirm your personal risk level is the most valuable preventive step a cardiac patient can take. If you have not had that visit yet, a quick call to your physician's office to confirm your medication schedule for fasting hours is still worthwhile. After Ramadan ends, a follow-up check-in is a sensible safety measure for higher-risk patients, as medication needs can shift when normal eating patterns resume.</p>\n\n<div class=\"article-refs\"><div class=\"article-refs-title\">References</div><ol><li>Akhtar AM, et al.
